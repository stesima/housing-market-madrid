# Introduction

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the key factors influencing rental and buying property prices in Madrid, a city with a dynamic and competitive real estate landscape driven by rising urbanization and increasing demand. By conducting an exploratory data analysis, we aim to uncover insights into the characteristics and distributions of the data, focusing on factors such as property type, size, neighborhood, energy certification, and features like parking availability or garden access. This analysis also includes visualizing geographical trends across districts in Madrid to highlight patterns in house prices. To enhance the depth of the study, predictive modeling is employed to estimate property prices based on location and other attributes, allowing us to compare the performance of different models and determine the most effective approach for accurate predictions. This comprehensive analysis not only provides valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and residents but also serves as a reusable framework for analyzing real estate markets in other cities by adapting the code to different contexts.

## Related Work

Our project builds on previous studies that have applied machine learning and statistical methods to analyse housing markets. Kenyon, Arribas-Bel, and Robinson (2024) used clustering techniques to analyze spatial patterns in Madrid, emphasizing the role of location-based features in understanding housing sub-markets. Baldominos et al. (2018) applied predictive models to identify underpriced properties in Madrid, demonstrating how machine learning can generate actionable insights for real estate markets. Milcheva and Zhu (2020) reviewed various machine learning methods for house price prediction, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced models, such as gradient boosting and random forests, in capturing complex relationships. These works informed both our exploratory data analysis and modeling approach. Papers like Jafari and Akhavian (2019) often focus primarily on the most obvious factors influencing housing, such as size, location, and age. Similarly, this analysis addresses these factors in research question 1 but goes further by incorporating less obvious or seemingly irrelevant factors that might still hold predictive value. Through research question 3, this study broadens the scope by analyzing additional factors, like whether the exact address is hidden on online rental platforms, to enhance the predictive power in the housing market. Furthermore, some authors tend to focus exclusively on either the purchasing or rental market. This analysis bridges that gap by examining both markets, enabling meaningful comparisons between them.

## Research Questions

-   Question 1: What are the primary factors that influence real estate prices in Madrid? This question analyses the correlation of the renting and/or buying price with other variables, such as house type, size and other characteristics of the house and property.
-   Question 2: How does the location within Madrid affect real estate prices? Are there specific neighbourhoods appreciating or depreciating the prices? By using the neighbourhood variable, we aim to map the properties to specific areas within Madrid and to identify price trends within those areas.
-   Question 3: What impact do secondary features of the house and property have on real estate prices? In comparison to the first question which focuses on the main features of the house – such as the type, size and number of rooms – this question focuses on additional characteristics – such as the type of energy certificate, availability of parking spaces or access to a garden – and their correlation with the real estate price.
